collection of autotests for [Crowbar](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar)

SUSE using Crowbar in products such as Cloud and Storage, so it will be really helpful to have collection of tests for web interface and run them after each update to make sure that everything works as expected. 

This project will be written in python3 and [Splinter framework](https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

You can check out source code on the Gordon's [github page](https://github.com/Evalle/gordon)

p.s. the name of the project was inspired by [Gordon Freeman] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman) because who knows better how to deal with crowbar :) ?
