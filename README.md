# Gordon
Gordon is an collection of autotests for [Crowbar](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar). Currently it's working only with SOC6 which is the last version of SUSE Openstack Cloud. 

SUSE uses Crowbar in Cloud and Storage products so it's really helpful for us as testers to have a collection of tests for Crowbar web interface. 

There's a short video about gordon in action

This project is written in Python and uses [Splinter library](https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

p.s. the name of the project was inspired by [Gordon Freeman] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman) because who knows better how to deal with crowbar :) ?
