# Gordon
Gordon is an collection of autotests for [Crowbar](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar). Currently it's in the POC stage and it's working only with SOC6 which is the last version of SUSE Openstack Cloud. 

SUSE uses Crowbar in Cloud and Storage products and it takes some time to test each element of it's web interface (also, we need to do it twice - before and after each update) so it's really helpful for testers to have a collection of autotests for that. 

There's a short demonstration about gordon in action
![Animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evalle/gordon/master/desktop-animation.gif "Gordon in action")

and also video [![gordon](https://asciinema.org/a/3rov78z1vns1n5a7jpn37n55s.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/3rov78z1vns1n5a7jpn37n55s)


This project is written in Python and uses [Splinter library](https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

p.s. the name of the project was inspired by [Gordon Freeman] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman) because who knows better how to deal with crowbar :) ?
